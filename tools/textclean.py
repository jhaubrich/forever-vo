"""Turns raw WoW quest/gossip text into something a TTS model should read aloud.

# $c (the player's class) renders as "adventurer" like $n, which has two known
# faults: a line carrying both says "adventurer" twice, and "adventurer" is
# vowel-initial, so the 74 lines written "a $c" ("I cannot train a $c such as
# yourself") come out "a adventurer". "friend" fixes both -- consonant-initial,
# what Classic NPCs actually call you, and correct in every position the corpus
# uses -- at the cost of 2 possessive lines ("your first friend's robes").
#
# Deliberately NOT changed yet: 1,246 lines carry $c and 318 of them already
# have audio, so swapping the word costs ~1.1 h of GPU that the first full
# generation needs more. The fingerprints are seeded (generate.py --reindex), so
# whenever this changes, `generate.py --stale-only` finds exactly the affected
# files by itself. Revisit once the bulk backlog is done.
#
# One word for everyone either way: the audio is rendered once, so a per-player
# choice would mean a full extra copy of every $c line (~1,270 files, ~4.6 h)
# per option, and the word cannot be spliced in at runtime -- the client only
# has PlaySoundFile, and the clip would need to exist in each of the ~38 cloned
# voices to match the line around it.
